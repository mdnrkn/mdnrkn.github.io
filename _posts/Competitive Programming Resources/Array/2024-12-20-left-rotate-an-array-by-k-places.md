We are given an array `arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }` and need to left rotate it by k positions.\
In left rotation, we take elements from the beginning of the array and move them to the end, one by one.\
For example:

- If k = 2, the first two elements `{ 1, 2 }` move to the end.\
Result: `{ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2 }`.
- If k = 3, the first three elements `{ 1, 2, 3 }` move to the end.\
Result: `{ 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3 }`.

#### Brute Force Approach:

When k is greater than or equal to the array size n, we only need to perform the effective rotations:

**Effective Rotations:** `k = k % n`.

This is because a rotation of n places brings the array back to its original configuration.\
For example:

- If k = 8 and n = 7, then k = 8 % 7 = 1. Perform 1 effective rotation.
- If k = 20 and n = 7, then k = 20 % 7 = 6. Perform 6 effective rotations.

Explanation for Large k Values:

- If k = 8, it is equivalent to 7 + 1 (one effective rotation).
- If k = 15, it is equivalent to 7 + 7 + 1 (one effective rotation).
- Multiple rotations of size n (7 in this case) always bring the array back to its original form.

Algorithm:

- Save the first k elements: Store the first k elements in a temporary array.
- Shift the remaining elements: Move the remaining elements of the array to the left.
- Copy back the saved elements: Place the saved elements at the end of the array.


```cpp
void leftRotate(int arr[], int n, int k)
{
    k = k % n; // Handle cases where k >= n
    int tmp[k]; // Temporary array to store the first k elements

    // Step 1: Store the first k elements in tmp
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) tmp[i] = arr[i];

    // Step 2: Shift the remaining elements to the left
    for (int i = k; i < n; i++) arr[i - k] = arr[i];

    // Step 3: Copy the elements from tmp to the end of the array
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) arr[n - k + i] = tmp[i];
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> arr[i];

    int k;
    cin >> k;

    leftRotate(arr, n, k);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
```

Steps for `arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }` and k = 3:

- Temporary array `tmp[] = { 1, 2, 3 }`.
- Shift remaining elements: `arr[] = { 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7 }` â†’ `arr[] = { 4, 5, 6, 7, _, _, _}`.
- Place saved elements: `arr[] = { 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3 }`.

#### Time Complexity:

For the brute force approach, the time complexity is derived as follows:

- Copy the first k elements to a temporary array:

*This operation involves iterating over the first k elements, so the time complexity is O(k).*

- Shift the remaining (n âˆ’ k) elements to the left:

*We iterate over the remaining elements of the array and shift them left. This requires O(n âˆ’ k) operations.*

- Place the saved elements from the temporary array back into the array:

*We iterate over the k saved elements in the temporary array and place them at the end of the original array. This requires another O(k) operations.*

**Total Time Complexity:** O(k) + O(n âˆ’ k) + O(k) = O(n + k)

*In the worst case, when k is close to n, this can approach O(2n). However, the dominant term here is O(n), making it linear for practical purposes.*

#### Space Complexity:

For the brute force approach, the space complexity depends on the temporary array used to store the first k elements.

- Temporary Array:

*The array requires extra space to store the first k elements. Thus, the space complexity is proportional to O(k).*

- In-Place Operations:

*All the remaining operations (shifting and placing elements back) are performed in-place, so no additional space is used.*

Total Space Complexity: O(k)

*This is not optimal in cases where k is large compared to n.*

#### Optimal Approach :

To reduce space complexity to O(1), we can use the reversal algorithm.

Key Idea: To rotate the array, reverse parts of the array and then reverse the whole array.

Steps:

- Reverse the first k elements.
- Reverse the remaining (n âˆ’ k) elements.
- Reverse the entire array.

For example:
Given `arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }` and k = 3:

- Reverse the first k elements `{ 1, 2, 3 }` â†’ `{ 3, 2, 1 }`.
Result: `{ 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 }`.
- Reverse the remaining (n âˆ’ k) elements `{ 4, 5, 6, 7 }` â†’ `{ 7, 6, 5, 4 }`.
Result: `{ 3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4 }`.
- Reverse the entire array â†’ `{ 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3 }`.

```cpp
// In case we need to write the reverse function manually
void reverse(int arr[], int start, int end)
{
    while (start < end)
    {
        int tmp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = tmp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

void leftRotate(int arr[], int n, int k)
{
    k = k % n; // Handle cases where k >= n

    // Step 1: Reverse the first k elements
    reverse(arr, 0, k - 1);

    // Step 2: Reverse the remaining elements
    reverse(arr, k, n - 1);

    // Step 3: Reverse the entire array
    reverse(arr, 0, n - 1);
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> arr[i];

    int k;
    cin >> k;

    leftRotate(arr, n, k);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
```

Steps for `arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }` and k = 3:

- Reverse `{ 1, 2, 3 }` â†’ `{ 3, 2, 1 }` â†’ `arr[] = { 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 }`.
- Reverse `{ 4, 5, 6, 7 }` â†’ `{ 7, 6, 5, 4 }` â†’ `arr[] = { 3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4 }`.
- Reverse the entire array â†’ `{ 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3 }`.

#### Time Complexity:

- Reverse first k elements: O(k).
- Reverse last (n âˆ’ k) elements: O(n âˆ’ k).
- Reverse the entire array: O(n).

Total: O(2n)

#### Space Complexity: 

O(1), as no extra space is used.

*This approach is efficient and optimal for large arrays.*
